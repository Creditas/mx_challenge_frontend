### 🧑‍🎨 Layout 
+ What to do?
    - Re-create it similar, be careful with the details (the little animations).
    - Layout the whole form from scratch, it means, you should create your own form components what satisfy the functionality shown above.
+ How to do it?
    - You can use whatever you want (Vanilla CSS, Sass/Scss, JSS, etc.) Make it easy and comfortable for you.
    - Use a methodology to name your classnames.
### 🧑‍🔧 Functionality
+ What to do?
    - While the user is typing the card info, change it in the card layout.
    - Stand out ( in the card layout ) the info that the user is typing.
    - Detect the the financial entity with the first digits of the card number, in this case detect VISA **( 4\*\*\* )**, MASTERCARD **( [ 51 | 52 | 53 | 54 | 55 ] \*\* )** and AMEX **( 3\*\*\* )**. 
+ How to do it?
    - Use React and some state manager.
    - Make it like components, we are also checking the file structure.
### 🤩 Extra Point 
A good programmer always tests his code, so give it a chance to test your components.
